# mapptrak-sample-hybrid

This Automation Studio project demonstrates how to combine an **ACOPOStrak system** with a conventional conveyor belt.  
The workspace of the ACOPOStrak system is extended using virtual segments ([B&R Online Help](https://www.br-automation.com)).  

This sample project showcases how to synchronize shuttle movement on the ACOPOStrak and the conveyor, and highlights the shuttle transfer between the two systems.

## üß© Overview
- The application uses a **virtual segment** to simulate conveyor belt behavior.  
- Shuttles on the conveyor are simulated with a **constant conveyor velocity**.  
- At the end of the conveyor, shuttles are transferred using `MC_BR_SecAddShuttle_AcpTrak`.
